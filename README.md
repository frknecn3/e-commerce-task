 # E-commerce Website Project

This is a React E-commerce website project I created. It features three main pages that handle basically the fundamentals of any e-commerce website: Product Listing Page, Details Page and Cart Page. It uses Local Storage to store cart data, RTK Query to fetch data from a fake e-commerce API and lists it with ease. React Router DOM handles all the routing and feeds the project with the URL parameters it needs for proper data queries.
